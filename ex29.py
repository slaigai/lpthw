# Study Drills

# 1. the if keyword will only run the code indented under it if the condition is True

# 2. To indicate that it is to be run if the condition is met. It's just python syntax...

# 3. If the code under the if is not indented, it runs unconditionally.

# 4. Nah

# 5. It prints out different things depending on what values you give it...
