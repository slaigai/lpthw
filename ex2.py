# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")


# Study Drills


# 1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or
# pound character).
#
# It was a comment symbol that I'll call "pound"


# 2. Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse
# against what you should have typed.
#
# Okay, looks good!


# 3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#
# Nope, no mistakes. Made sure to type character by character like the book says to do even thought I felt like I
# already knew how to comment stuff out. Trying to build the discipline to do stuff that I don't want to do for the sake
# of learning to learn effectively. I was introduced to reading stuff backwards to check for errors by my ISE professor.
# It was super effective.


# 4. Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix
# them.
#
# Okay. Interesting drill. Made me realize how hard it is to "speak" what I'm typing. Might help in pair programming
# when we try to tell each other what to type.
